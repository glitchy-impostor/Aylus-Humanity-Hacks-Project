            <p>Tons of waste such as plastics, textiles, wood, and glass are produced and sent to landfills. Many companies have addressed this problem of upcycling used materials into usable products and art pieces. Upcycle is a website that links individuals with upcycling companies which can transform their waste into valuable merchandise.</p>
            <p>Events such as cleaning the beaches are hosted on the platform to create awareness of environmental volunteer work. The waste collected from these events are also delivered to the participating companies. The platform then lists products for sale made by the upcycling companies to promote the waste reduction and upcycling startups.</p>
            <p>Donating recyclable waste should be easy and free, that’s why Upcycle bears all delivery charges from donating individuals. All you have to do is pick a company that recycles your type of waste, for example textiles, schedule a pick up time and hand your materials over to the courier, picked up from your doorstep and free-of-charge.</p>
            <p>The company you picked was a startup named Textile Recycled, and they paid a subscription fee to be listed on the Upcycle website. Even though they are a company from halfway across the globe, they still receive your materials because Upcycle’s has set up a collection point in your country. And now textile donations from you and hundreds of other donors are picked up from the collection point and shipped to the Textile Recycled factory. The materials are repurposed and made into jackets, pillows, tapestries, etc, and are put up for sale on the Upcycle marketplace. </p>
            <p>Now anyone from anywhere in the world can do their part in reducing waste by donating to a participating company, and purchasing upcycled products as easily as buying on Amazon or AliExpress.</p>
